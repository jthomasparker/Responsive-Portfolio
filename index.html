                        Hi, I'm Josh and I live in Metro Atlanta with my beautiful wife and two cute dogs. We enjoy traveling, camping/hiking, and trying new things together.

                        I would say that my journey into coding began as a child obsessed with baseball statistics. As I grew up, I realized that it wasn't the baseball statistics that I loved, but just the actual data. Combined with my enjoyment of solving problems, I began searching for ways to improve processes and remove inefficiencies at work by collecting and analyzing data. I started by building a complex system of intertwining Google Sheets to collect and analyze my department's productivity. To make this system work how I wanted, I had to learn a little Google App Script, which was my first real taste of coding. From there, I realized how powerful coding can be: the ability to create almost anything out of nothing. I wanted to explore this more, so I took a free C# class offered by my library. I was hooked. I took every class they offered from SQL and database management to C# and javascript. I began using my newly acquired skills to solve even more problems at my company, creating small C# utility applications to automate much of our processes and collect/analyze even more data to produce actionable reports for our managers. I've come a long way since that first library class, but sitting here in Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp, I can't help but think that my journey has only just begun. And I couldn't be more excited.
